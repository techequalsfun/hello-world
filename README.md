# hello-world
1st Github repository.  Repositories are usually for single projects.
By default repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.
On Github, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes.
When you open a pull request, youâ€™re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.


Note:  1st edited README while in master repository.   Then created branch. Then edited file 2nd time while in master and deleted it in master.  What happens when I do pull request for copy in branch that's no longer in master?
