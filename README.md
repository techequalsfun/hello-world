1st Github repository.  Repositories are usually for single projects.
By default repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.
On Github, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes.
